# LearningCpp
My personal C++ playarea with experiments that are mostly useless.
This code is not up to proper c++ standards or anything that's why it's a
playground. It's not production code, it's fun toy's that do nothing usefull.

# Why?!
Why would you spend your time on this crap? Cause it's fun you rage monkey.
Programming = fun period and i'm learning C++ to create cool stuff in the future!
also I needed a backup so I just dump it on GitHub since i'm to lazy to setup a
gitlab/go git service for it at the moment.

# What's in here?
Well first thing i'm trying to create is a gravity particle simulation. It uses
the Barns Hutt algoritm to smooth over the calcuations and make it run 
at a passable speed. I'm currently rewriting the codebase to make the algoritm
run in multiple threads so it's faster! but that's still a work in progress.

## That sounds advanced... is it?
No... hell no... it's just a rough implementation of the Barns Hutt algorithm. 
But it does kind of work even the collisions look quite fun when huge swarms of 
particles colide with eachother. It's more a desk toy you turn on to look at 
to forget that you should have done school stuff 3 days ago...

### I'm your teacher can i use that last line as evidence?
No. what you should do is drop C# and teach us c++.


( By the way that last line was a joke. I'm not that sassy in real life )
